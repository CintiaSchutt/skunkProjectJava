# skunkProjectJava
A creation of the SKUNK game from scratch using object-oriented concepts. 
A pair of dice is rolled, and a player decides whether to roll again or to stop. 
If a single one is rolled, then the round is lost, if "snake eyes" are rolled then the game is lost. 
Otherwise, the current score is updated.
